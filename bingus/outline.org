* Hi
* How to Design Programs
** What is HtDP?
** The design recipe (step by step)
** Templates in relation to enumeration and structure signatures
** Hey this looks like something a computer can do
* Existing synthesis approaches
** Type-and-example directed synthesis
* Adapting them for HtDP
** We need a way to pull constants
** Our approach of doing BFS on refinements
* Where to go from here
** Doing Dijkstra instead of BFS
** What if one of these refinements generated a helper function?
